# Examples

## Problem A.1 
### **Problem Description**
This test problem is a variant of the internet switching model introduced by **Kesselman et al.** and further analyzed by **Facchinei et al**. There are $N$ players, each player having a single variable $x^{\nu} \in \mathbb{R}$. The objective function are given by $$ \theta_{\nu}(\mathbf{x}) := \frac{-x^{\nu}}{x^{1}+\ldots+x^{N}}\left(1-\frac{x^{1}+\ldots+x^{N}}{B}\right) \quad \forall \nu=1, \ldots, N $$ for some constant $B$. We set $N=10$ and $B=1$. The constraints of the first player are $0.3 \leq x^{1} \leq 0.5$, while the remaining players' constraints are $$ x^{1}+\ldots+x^{N} \leq B, \quad x^{\nu} \geq 0.01. $$ Note that the objective functions are not continuous at $x=0$ which, however, is an infeasible point. This variant of the basic problem, described in Example A.14, gives the first player a "privileged status".

### **Python Implementation**
This class defines the **Problem A.1** setup for an Unbounded Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP).
Each method defines one component of the mathematical formulation:

        player_objective_functions = [0 for _ in range(n)]  # change to all 0s
        player_constraints = [[1,2], [0,3], [0,3], [0,3], [0,3], [0,3], [0,3], [0,3], [0,3], [0,3]]

        #  upper bound
        return (x[0] - 0.5).reshape(-1,1)

    @staticmethod
    def g3(x: VectorList) -> Vector:
        t = np.vstack([s.reshape(-1,1) for s in x[1:]])
        return (0.01 - t).reshape(-1,1)

    @staticmethod
    def g0_der(x: VectorList) -> Vector:

        solver1 = GNEP_Solver_Unbounded(
            problem['obj_funcs'],
            problem['obj_ders'],
            problem['constraints'],
            problem['constraint_ders'],
            player_objective_functions,
