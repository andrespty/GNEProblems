       <span style="background-color:#7B68EE; color:white; padding:2px 6px; border-radius:4px;">Class</span>

       Solve an unbounded Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP).

       Implements an energy-based method to compute Nash equilibria
       in multi-player optimization problems with objectives and constraints.
       Each player has an objective function and a set of constraints, and
       gradients are used to build energy functions for both primal and dual
       players.

       Parameters
       ----------
       obj_funcs : list of ObjFunction
           List of objective functions, one for each player or shared across
           multiple players. Each function accepts a list of player action
           vectors and returns a scalar.
       derivative_obj_funcs : list of ObjFunctionGrad
           List of gradients of the objective functions. Each gradient function
           returns either the full gradient (shape = (sum(action_sizes), 1))
           or a partial gradient for its own variables (shape = (n_i, 1)).
       constraints : list of ConsFunction
           List of constraint functions. Each function takes all player
           action vectors and returns a constraint value or vector.
       derivative_constraints : list of ConsFunctionGrad
           List of gradients of the constraints with respect to the actions.
       player_obj_func : list of int
           Indices specifying which objective function corresponds to each player.
       player_constraints : list of PlayerConstraint
           Indices specifying which constraints apply to each player.
       player_vector_sizes : list of int
           Sizes of each player's action vector. The sum determines the dimension
           of the action space.

       Attributes
       ----------
       objective_functions : list of ObjFunction
           Original objective functions.
       objective_function_derivatives : list of ObjFunctionGrad
           Gradients of the objective functions.
       constraints : list of ConsFunction
           Constraint functions.
       constraint_derivatives : list of ConsFunctionGrad
           Gradients of the constraints.
       player_objective_function : vector
           Encodes which objective function is used for each player.
       player_constraints : vector
           Encodes which constraints are used for each player.
       action_sizes : list of int
           Sizes of each player's action vector.
       N : int
           Number of players.
       result : scipy.optimize.OptimizeResult
           Result object returned by the solver after calling `solve_game`.
       time : float
           Elapsed computation time (seconds).

       Examples

       >>> import numpy as np
       >>> # Define two simple player objectives
